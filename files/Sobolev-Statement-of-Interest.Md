I apply text analysis and deep learning to collective behavior in authoritarian regimes, I explore the strategies that modern autocrats use to survive in office and how citizens and firms respond to these strategies.

My current projects focus on two such strategies: manufacturing the image of invincibility by pro-government rallies, and creating an army of paid supporters (“trolls”) on the Internet that attempts to shape the narrative and disrupt online conversation.

I would be glad to serve as a discussant in sections focusing on comparative politics in general, including politics in modern developing countries, post-soviet countries, civil conflicts, protest behavior (including recent protests in the U.S.), mass media, and social media.
