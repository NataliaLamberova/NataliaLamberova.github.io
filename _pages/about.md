I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Center for International Strategy, Technology and Policy at Georgia Tech. My research applies game-theoretic and network modeling, causal inference, and experiments to the study of government Research and Development policy. More broadly, I study the interaction between business, technology, and politics.

My dissertation documents how public funding impacts countries’ technological development. Since the results of R&D investments typically emerge years after the elected incumbent leaves her office, why do politicians pursue such policies? I explore three incentive-generating scenarios that could explain observed government R&D investment: rent-seeking, skill signaling, and pork-barrel politics.

My work has been published in, among others, [Journal of Comparative Economics](doi.org/10.1016/j.jce.2021.01.002), [_European Journal of Political Economy_](doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2019.08.003), and [_Economics of Transition_](doi.org/10.1111/ecot.12167) and presented at international conferences in Economics (ASSA, EEA, SIOE) and Political Science (APSA, MPSA, Polmeth). Prior to my appointment at Georgia Tech, I received my Ph.D. in Government and M.Sc. in Statistics from University of California, Los Angeles.
