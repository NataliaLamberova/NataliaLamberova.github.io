I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science and MSc in Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles. My research applies a mixture game-theoretic modeling, causal inference, natural and survey experiments data to the study political incentives of government Research and Development policy. 

Government funding of research and development impacts countriesâ€™ technological development. Since the results of such policies typically emerge only after the politician who funded the R&D has stood for re-election, why do incumbent politicians make such investments? My dissertation research introduces three possible incentive-generating scenarios that could explain observed government R&D investment: rent-seeking, skill signalling, and strengthening future coalitions. 

I am also interested in the impact of new technology on collective action. In two projects  co-authored with [Dmitry Dagaev (Moscow, HSE)](https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/ddagaev), [Anton Sobolev (UCLA)](asobolev.com) and [Konstantin Sonin (Univeristy of Chicago)](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/konstantin-sonin), I study how communication technology has changed the architecture of social movements worldwide.

My work also includes developing a direct measure of political connections between countries (as opposed to current measures of policy similarity) (together with [Anton Sobolev (UCLA)](asobolev.com), [Robert Trager (UCLA)](https://polisci.ucla.edu/people/robert-trager ) and [Art Stein (UCLA)](https://polisci.ucla.edu/people/arthur-stein).
