I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science and MSc in Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles. My research applies a mixture game-theoretic modeling, causal inference, natural and survey experiments data to the study political incentives of government Research and Development policy.  

Government funding of research and development impacts countries’ technological development. Since the results of such policies typically emerge only after the politician who funded the R&D has stood for re-election, why do incumbent politicians make such investments? My dissertation research introduces three possible incentive-generating scenarios that could explain observed government R&D investment: rent-seeking, skill signalling, and strengthening future coalitions. 

I am also interested in the impact of new technology on collective action. In two projects  co-authored with [Dmitry Dagaev (Moscow, HSE)](https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/ddagaev), [Anton Sobolev (UCLA)](asobolev.com) and [Konstantin Sonin (Univeristy of Chicago)](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/konstantin-sonin), I study how communication technology has changed the architecture of social movements worldwide.

In statistics field, I apply latent networks models to summarize Interational Relations data into an informative uni-dimensional measure of political connections (as opposed to current measures of policy similarity) (together with [Anton Sobolev (UCLA)](asobolev.com), [Robert Trager (UCLA)](https://polisci.ucla.edu/people/robert-trager ) and [Art Stein (UCLA)](https://polisci.ucla.edu/people/arthur-stein). that can be applied in International Trade and International Conflict studies. We also develop dynamic network models of state-to-state relations.

I am available for interviews at APSA (2019) and AEA (2020)
