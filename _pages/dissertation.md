My dissertation,*Political Economy of Technological Advancement*, examines the political constraints on government Research and Development (R&D) policy and their effect on the efficiency of such policy.
  
Research that succeeds in boosting innovation typically does so only after a significant time lag, meaning that the results of such policy decisions may become apparent only after the government officeholders who made these decisions have been up for reelection or may even have left office entirely. Thus, what motivates an incumbent officeholder to invest in such policies, which generate a return only after the incumbent can no longer derive any personal benefit (i.e., increased chances of reelection)? Moreover, unlike the outcomes of many other types of policies having long-term horizons (e.g., infrastructure construction or education reform), those of research and development (R&D) policies are much less visible to the public.
My research focuses on three possible explanations: electoral benefit, rent-seeking, and strengthening future coalitions.

Specifically, my dissertation documents increased perception of competentce of incumbents that put R&D to the forefont of their agenda (compared to pro-education, pro-infrastructure and pro-commercialization of innovation) using survey experiment in USA and Russia, and corroborates its findings with cross-country data.
The second chapter of my disseratation shows that rent-seeking through R&D investment can lead to lower quality of patents produced under government incentives, and can also lead to unravelling of the market for technology. The third chapter of my dissertation suggests that government support for R&D can lead to increased market power of recipients of government grants.

## Findings

My analysis results in three important findings.

* * *First*, under assumption that policymakers value the economic outcomes of their policy, and that gains from holding office are not too high, there exists a separating equilibrium where high-skilled politicians invest in research and development, while low-skilled politicians invest is less risky policy, while voters prefer pro-R&D politician. Survey experiments conducted in USA and Russia are consistent with this result. This conclusion holds in cross-country setting.

* *Second*, politicians that are less concerned with reelection can generate rents from their R&D policy. In this case, government investment in R&D incentivize the production of low-quality patents, that leads to unravelling of the market for technologies. This is consistent with the evidence from natural experiment in Russia.

* *Third*, government can influence long-term market power of companies, engaged in R&D, by providing direct government grants.


## Contributions and Policy-implications

- *First*, there is a large body of literature investigation the impacts of government R&D policy on technological development, but no study examines the political constraints of incumbent engaging in long-term, risky and not very visible policy. My dissertation suggests the number of incentives that could explain significant government funding directed to R&D.

- *Second*, my work shows, that, depending on the set of political incentives, incumbents can choose specific tools of providing support for entities engaged in developing of new technologies, and these tools can determine the impact of government policy on the economy.

- *Third*, it highlights the importance of political accountability for the technological development of countries.
