## CURRENT TEACHING 

**Georgia  Institute of Technology**, ***Sam Nunn School of International Affairs*** (Fall 2021)           

 * Political Economy of Post-Communism 

This course provides the introduction to political economy of Post-Soviet countries. First, we will briefly revise the toolkit of the modern social scientist, focusing on strategic reasoning and empirical analysis of evidense. Next, will first overview the political, economic, and social structures that defined Soviet Union. We will focus on lasting distortiones created by the planned economy, and the features of that time period that affect modern day countries. Next, we will explore the “transition” in national identities, political institutions and economic systems that followed the collapse of Soviet Communism, and will explore the different developmental trajectories chosed by the 15 successor states of the Soviet Union. Finally, we will analyze modern day economy and politics, utilizing the insights we have built.

Students get free access to short courses on DataCamp to prepare themselves for the coding part of this course. [Link to DataCamp for Georgia Tech students](#link)
